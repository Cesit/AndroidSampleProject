# Android Sample Project
An example/boilerplate Android app.

### Third party libraries
I wanted to make this sample app without any third party libraries, but then I used Jake Wharton's [Butterknife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) anyway.

### TODO  
- Add profile on-boarding.  
- Add mock login / sign up flow.  
- Add profile page.
- Add "Create Item" popup form.

### Notes
Custom icons from [Icons8](https://icons8.com).
